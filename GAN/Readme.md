Hello!

I have implemented a GAN using keras. I trained the model on the MNIST dataset.

In the second part of the project, I made my model generate images of the MNIST dataset.

The images are named in the format 'MNIST_x.png' where x is the number of epoch when the image was generated.

The output for the 0th iteration was just random noise, but as epochs increase, the clarity of images improve! These have been generated by the model itself!!

Do checkout my output folder to see the results :)
