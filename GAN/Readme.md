## Hello!

I have implemented a GAN using keras. I trained the model on the MNIST dataset. </br>
In the second part of the project, I made my model generate images of the MNIST dataset. </br>
The images are named in the format 'MNIST_x.png' where x is the number of epoch when the image was generated. </br>
The output for the 0th iteration was just random noise, but as epochs increase, the clarity of images improve! These have been generated by the model itself!!</br>
Do checkout my output folder to see the results :)</br>
